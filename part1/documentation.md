## 1. Introduction

### Purpose
This document serves as the comprehensive technical blueprint for the **HBnB Evolution** application. It details the system's architecture, business logic structure, and the interaction flow between different layers. The purpose is to guide the development team through the implementation phase by strictly defining data structures, architectural patterns, and communication protocols.

### Scope
The document covers:
* **High-Level Architecture:** The layered design (Presentation, Business Logic, Persistence) using the Facade pattern.
* **Business Logic:** Detailed class definitions and entity relationships.
* **API Flows:** Sequence diagrams illustrating key system operations.

## 2. High-Level Architecture

### Overview
The application follows a **Layered Architecture** to ensure separation of concerns, scalability, and maintainability. It uses the **Facade Pattern** to provide a simplified interface to the business logic and persistence layers.
