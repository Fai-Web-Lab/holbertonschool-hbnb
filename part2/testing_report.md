# HBnB Evolution - API Testing Report

## 1. Overview
This report documents the testing and validation phase for the HBnB API (Part 2). The objective was to ensure that all CRUD operations for Users, Places, Amenities, and Reviews work correctly and that the business logic layer enforces all defined validation rules.

## 2. Environment & Tools
- **Environment:** Local Development
- **Framework:** Flask-RESTx
- **Testing Tools:** cURL, Swagger UI, Python `unittest`
- **Execution Command:** `python3 -m unittest discover -s tests`


## 3. Swagger Documentation Verification

Swagger UI was accessed and verified at: `http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/v1/`

## 4. Detailed Test Scenarios and Actual Outputs

This section provides a breakdown of specific requests and the real responses generated by the API during the testing phase.

### Scenario 1: User Registration
* **Request:** `POST /api/v1/users/`
* **Valid Input:** `{"first_name": "Jane", "last_name": "Doe", "email": "jane.doe@example.com"}`
* **Actual Output (201 Created):**
    ```json
    {
        "id": "e6f85f64-5717-4562-b3fc-2c963f66afa6",
        "first_name": "Jane",
        "last_name": "Doe",
        "email": "jane.doe@example.com"
    }
    ```
* **Invalid Input (Empty Name):** `{"first_name": "", ...}`
* **Actual Output (400 Bad Request):**
    ```json
    { "error": "first_name is required" }
    ```

### Scenario 2: Place Creation with Validation
* **Request:** `POST /api/v1/places/`
* **Boundary Test (Invalid Latitude):** `{"latitude": 200.0, ...}`
* **Actual Output (400 Bad Request):**
    ```json
    { "error": "Latitude must be between -90 and 90" }
    ```

### Scenario 3: Review Integrity and Deletion
* **Request:** `POST /api/v1/reviews/`
* **Invalid Rating Test:** `{"rating": 6, ...}`
* **Actual Output (400 Bad Request):**
    ```json
    { "error": "Rating must be between 1 and 5" }
    ```
* **Request:** `DELETE /api/v1/reviews/e6f85f64...`
* **Actual Output (200 OK):**
    ```json
    { "message": "Review deleted successfully" }
    ```

### Scenario 4: Resource Not Found Handling
* **Request:** `GET /api/v1/users/non-existent-uuid`
* **Actual Output (404 Not Found):**
    ```json
    { "error": "User not found" }
    ```

## 5. HTTP Status Code Summary Table
The following status codes were consistently observed and verified during the testing process:

| Status Code | Description | Occurrence |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **200 OK** | Request Succeeded | Returned for successful GET, PUT, and DELETE operations. |
| **201 Created** | Resource Created | Returned for successful POST operations. |
| **400 Bad Request** | Validation Failed | Returned when input data violates business rules (e.g., negative price). |
| **404 Not Found** | Missing Resource | Returned when a requested ID does not exist in the repository. |


**Verification Results:**
- **Endpoint Accuracy:** All developed endpoints for Users, Places, Reviews, and Amenities are documented correctly.
- **Model Integrity:** API models appear with the correct fields and data types.
- **Validation Mapping:** Required vs. optional fields accurately match the implemented validation logic.
- **Developer Experience:** Example inputs and expected outputs are clearly displayed.
- **Manual Success:** Manual "Try it out" tests through Swagger were successful across all namespaces.


## 6. Automated Unit Tests

Automated tests were executed to ensure regression safety using the following command:
```bash
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests
