## Overview
 HBnB Evolution is a simplified AirBnB-like backend application focused on system design and architecture. This phase emphasizes creating UML-based technical documentation that defines core entities, business rules, and interactions to guide future implementation.

## Project Stages
**1. High-Level Package Diagram:** 


**2. Class Diagram for Business Logic Layer:**

Show the main business entities, the data they contain, and how they relate to each other.


**3. Sequence Diagrams:**  
Visualize how core API requests flow through the Presentation, Business Logic, and Persistence layers in the HBnB application. The diagrams clarify component interactions and data flow for key use cases, serving as a blueprint for implementation.
